## Problem Statement

DuitLog started as a personal expense tracker for one couple. The core value proposition — "log expenses in under 10 seconds, keep all analysis power in Google Sheets" — resonates with a broader audience. However, the current implementation is deeply personalized: hardcoded sources (Danny/Dewi/Together), hardcoded categories and payment methods, a single shared spreadsheet ID in an env var, and a simple passcode for auth.

To serve multiple users, DuitLog needs real authentication, per-user configuration, and a way for each user to connect their own Google Sheet — all without losing the speed and simplicity that makes it useful.

## Goals

1. **Multi-user support** — anyone can sign up, configure their own expense tracker, and use it independently.
2. **Per-user Google Sheets** — each user connects their own spreadsheet via Google OAuth. The app reads/writes to their sheet on their behalf.
3. **Customizable fields** — each user defines their own sources, categories, and payment methods during onboarding (and can edit later).
4. **Zero-config spreadsheet setup** — the app creates the spreadsheet and monthly tabs for the user automatically.
5. **Preserve the core UX** — the expense form must remain fast, mobile-first, and under 10 seconds from open to saved.
6. **Retain existing features** — monthly tab organization, offline queue with background sync, PWA installability.

## Non-Goals (SaaS v1)

- Billing / paid tiers (free for now, evaluate later).
- Shared household accounts (each user has their own sheet; couples can share a Google Sheet manually outside the app).
- Admin dashboard or usage analytics.
- White-labeling or custom domains.
- Data export beyond Google Sheets (the sheet IS the export).

## User Personas

**New User (Non-technical)** — Heard about DuitLog from a friend. Has a Google account. Wants to start tracking expenses immediately. Has no idea what a "service account" or "spreadsheet ID" is. Needs a smooth onboarding that creates everything for them.

**Power User** — Already has a Google Sheet with their own expense tracking format. Wants to connect their existing sheet and customize the app to match their categories. Comfortable with a few setup steps.

**Returning User (Danny)** — Current user migrating from the personal version. Needs to connect his existing spreadsheet and configure the same sources/categories/methods.

## Key User Journeys

### J1: Sign Up & Onboarding (First-time)

1. Land on DuitLog homepage → "Sign in with Google".
2. Clerk handles Google OAuth, including requesting Sheets API permissions.
3. On first login, redirected to onboarding wizard:
   - **Step 1 — Spreadsheet**: Choose "Create a new spreadsheet" (auto-setup) or "Connect an existing spreadsheet" (paste URL or pick from Drive).
   - **Step 2 — Sources**: Define money sources (e.g., "Me", "Wife", "Joint"). Starts with sensible defaults, user can add/remove/rename.
   - **Step 3 — Categories**: Define expense categories. Starts with defaults (Food, Transport, etc.), user can customize.
   - **Step 4 — Payment Methods**: Define payment methods. Starts with defaults, user can customize.
4. App saves config to database.
5. If "Create new" was chosen: app creates a Google Spreadsheet in the user's Drive, adds the current month's tab with header row.
6. Redirected to the main expense form — ready to use.

### J2: Log an Expense (Existing User)

Same as the personal version:

1. Open PWA → expense form with month selector.
2. Sources, categories, and methods are loaded from the user's config in the database.
3. Submit → server uses the user's Google OAuth token to append to their spreadsheet.
4. Success toast.

### J3: Manage Settings

1. Navigate to Settings page.
2. View/edit sources, categories, payment methods (add, remove, rename, reorder).
3. View connected spreadsheet (link to open in Sheets).
4. Disconnect and reconnect a different spreadsheet.
5. Account settings (sign out, delete account).

### J4: Offline Submission (Unchanged)

Same as current implementation — entries queue in IndexedDB, sync when back online via `/api/sync`.

| Shared household accounts (multiple users → one spreadsheet)     | v2    |
| Billing / usage limits                                           | v2    |
| Spreadsheet templates (preset configs for different use cases)   | v2    |

| Dashboard widgets in the app (pulling from Sheets analysis tabs) | v3    |

## UX Expectations

Everything from the personal version still applies (mobile-first, one-hand, numeric keyboard, smart defaults). Additionally:

- **Onboarding must be completable in under 2 minutes** — most users should tap through defaults without changing anything.
- **Settings changes take effect immediately** — no "save and restart" flow.
- **The expense form must not feel slower** despite loading config from a database. Config should be cached or loaded in the route loader efficiently.
